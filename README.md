## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository to your computer from this link: https://github.com/selincam/MwsRestaurantStage1.
2. From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal:
**Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000**
**Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000**
3. Visit the site in your browser at **http://localhost:8000**

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Specification

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

## Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
